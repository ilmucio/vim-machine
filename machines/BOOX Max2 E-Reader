Description:

The Boox Max 2 E-Reader is an e-ink device that features a 1.6G Quad-core CPU, 13.3 dual touch HD display, 
and can be turned into a portable monitor or a secondary monitor. It is Bluetooth keyboard compatible and 
even has a monitor stand attachment. It currently runs android out of the box and supports Google Play. 
Google play supports Termux, (a terminal emulator for android that uses its Linux roots) and finally Termux
supports Vim. You would need to install ssh as well, so it would be "pkg install openssh".
After that, you should be good to go. This however is untested on the device and hasn't been verified yet. 

This may be more expensive than intended, but it should likely work out of the box without voiding the warranty of the e reader.
Which might I add, can also be used for several other things other than vim if you so choose as it is an android device. 
Such as reading if that wasn't obvious.

This is a video of someone using it a monitor.
