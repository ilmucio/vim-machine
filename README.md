# Vim Machine

A repo to share idea on customize a machine for the use of vim.

I posted on reddit about some of the things I'd love to have on a machine fully dedicated to vim.
Some people give their opinions and preferences on that. 

Here I will try to gather the references they are giving, integrate with more and make a syntesis.


In [Pro and Cons](https://github.com/ilmucio/vim-machine/blob/master/proandcons.md) I will try to put 
for some of the more controversial choice pro and cons.

In [Links](https://github.com/ilmucio/vim-machine/blob/master/links.md) the references of projects, productcs, articles, discussion etc.
