# Vim Machine

A repo to share idea on customize a machine for the use of vim.

I posted on reddit about some of the things I'd love to have on a machine fully dedicated to vim.
Some people give their opinions and preferences on that. 

Here I will try to gather the references they are giving, integrate with more and make a syntesis.
